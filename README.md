3.Run The Code ---> python gender.py

# DataSet
Here Is The Data Set That We Have Used In Our Code.
``` python
DataSet = [[165, 66, 16], [163, 98, 15], [148, 34, 17], [173, 54, 18], [191, 70, 16],[190, 90, 17], [175, 64, 28],
[182, 45, 28], [164, 87, 17], [142, 68, 16], [176, 57, 21]]
```
# Gender 
Here Is The Second Step That We've Used For Classifying Our DataSet.

General Culture ---> homina = man | domina = women
``` python
Gender = ["homina", "homina", "domina", "domina", "homina", "homina", "domina", "domina",
"domina", "homina", "homina"]
```
